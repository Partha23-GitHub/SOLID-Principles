**The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**

It states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, it encourages having small, focused interfaces that are tailored to the needs of specific clients rather than having large, monolithic interfaces that force clients to implement methods they don't need. Let's go through an example in Java to understand how to violate and then adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle.

**Violating the Interface Segregation Principle:**

Consider a scenario where we have an Animal interface that contains methods for both Swim and Fly, even though not all animals can both swim and fly.

```java
    interface Animal {
        void swim();
        void fly();
    }
```

```java
    class Bird implements Animal {
        @Override
        public void swim() {
            // Birds cannot swim, so this method is empty.
            System.out.print("I can Swim");
        }

        @Override
        public void fly() {
            // Bird-specific flying behavior.
            System.out.print("I can Fly");
        }
    }
```

```java
    class Fish implements Animal {
        @Override
        public void swim() {
            // Fish-specific swimming behavior.
            System.out.print("I can Swim");
        }

        @Override
        public void fly() {
            // Fish cannot fly, so this method is empty.
        }
    }
```

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Animal bird = new Bird();
            Animal fish = new Fish();

            bird.fly();
            bird.swim(); // Birds cannot swim, so this is an empty method call.

            fish.swim();
            fish.fly(); /* Fish cannot fly, but we have to implement it because of the interface so this is an empty method call.*/
        }
    }

```

In the above code, the Animal interface contains both swim and fly methods, and the Bird and Fish classes implement this interface. However, this violates the ISP because not all animals can both swim and fly. As a result, we have empty method implementations in the Bird and Fish classes for behaviors that are not applicable to them.

**Adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle:**

To adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle, we should have separate interfaces for Swim and Fly:

```java
    interface Swim {
        void swim();
    }
```

```java
    interface Fly {
        void fly();
    }
```

```java
    class Bird implements Fly {
        @Override
        public void fly() {
            // Bird-specific flying behavior.
             System.out.print("I can Fly");
        }
    }
```

```java
    class Fish implements Swim {
        @Override
        public void swim() {
            // Fish-specific swimming behavior.
            System.out.print("I can Swim");

        }
    }
```

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Fly bird = new Bird();
            Swim fish = new Fish();

            bird.fly();
            // bird.swim(); // This is not possible since Fly interface does not have a swim method.

            // fish.fly(); // This is not possible since Swim interface does not have a fly method.
            fish.swim();
        }
    }

```

In this adhering example, we have separate Swim and Fly interfaces, and the Bird and Fish classes implement the respective interfaces. Now, we have smaller, focused interfaces that adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle, and clients (objects) can depend only on the interfaces they need, without being forced to implement irrelevant methods.

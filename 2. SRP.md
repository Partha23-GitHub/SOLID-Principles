**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change.
In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or job.

Problem:
Imagine you are building a simple employee management system in Java, and you create an Employee class to represent employees.
In this class, you decide to include methods for calculating employee salaries and methods for writing employee data to a file.

Here's an example of what this Employee class might look like

```java
    public class Employee {
        private String name;
        private double salary;

        public Employee(String name, double salary) {
            this.name = name;
            this.salary = salary;
        }

        public void calculateSalary() {
            // Calculate employee's salary based on various factors.
            // ...
        }

        public void saveToFile() {
            // Write employee data to a file.
            // ...
        }
    }
```

Problem Explanation:
The Employee class has two responsibilities: 1. Calculating an employee's salary. 2. Saving employee data to a file.

This violates the SRP because the class has more than one reason to change. If the salary calculation logic or the file-saving logic needs to be updated or changed, it could affect unrelated parts of the class. This can lead to code that is harder to understand, maintain, and test.

Solution (SRP Implementation):
To adhere to the SRP, we should separate these responsibilities into distinct classes, each with a single responsibility.

Let's refactor the code:

```java
    public class Employee {
        private String name;
        private double salary;

        public Employee(String name, double salary) {
            this.name = name;
            this.salary = salary;
        }

            // Other employee-related methods...
    }

    public class SalaryCalculator {
        public double calculateSalary(Employee employee) {
            // Calculate employee's salary based on various factors.
            // ...
        }
    }

    public class FileWriter {
        public void saveToFile(Employee employee) {
            // Write employee data to a file.
            // ...
        }
    }
```

**SRP Implementation Explanation:**
Employee class: Now, the Employee class focuses solely on representing employee data, adhering to the SRP.
It doesn't have methods for salary calculation or file writing.

SalaryCalculator class: This class is responsible for calculating an employee's salary. It takes an Employee
object as input and performs the salary calculation, adhering to the SRP by having a single responsibility.

FileWriter class: This class is responsible for saving employee data to a file. Like the SalaryCalculator,
it takes an Employee object as input and handles the file-writing task, adhering to the SRP.

By following the SRP, you've made your code more maintainable and easier to extend. Changes to one responsibility
won't impact the other, and each class now has a clear and single purpose.

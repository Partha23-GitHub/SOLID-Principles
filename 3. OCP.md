**Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (such as classes, modules, or functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code.

Problem:
Imagine you are developing a drawing application in Java, and you have a class called Shape that represents various geometric shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles. Each shape has a draw method.

Here's a simplified example:

```java
    public class Shape {
        private String type;

        public Shape(String type) {
            this.type = type;
        }

        public void draw() {
            if (type.equals("circle")) {
                System.out.println("Draw a circle");
            } else if (type.equals("rectangle")) {
                System.out.println("Draw a rectangle");
            } else if (type.equals("triangle")) {
                System.out.println("Draw a triangle");
            }
        }
    }

```

Problem Explanation:
The problem with this design is that it violates the OCP. If you want to add a new shape, say a "square," you need to modify the Shape class by adding another conditional statement to the draw method. This means the class is not closed for modification.

Solution (OCP Implementation):
To adhere to the OCP, we should design the system in a way that allows for adding new shapes without modifying the existing Shape class. This can be achieved by using inheritance and abstraction.

Let's refactor the code:

```java
    public abstract class Shape {
        public abstract void draw();
    }

    public class Circle extends Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Draw a circle");
        }
    }

    public class Rectangle extends Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Draw a rectangle");
        }
    }

    public class Triangle extends Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Draw a triangle");
        }
    }

    // Adding a new shape (Square) without modifying existing code
    public class Square extends Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Draw a square");
        }
    }

```

**OCP Implementation Explanation:**

1. Shape class is now an abstract class with an abstract draw method. It defines the common interface for all shapes.

2. Each specific shape (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, and the newly added Square) is a separate class that extends the Shape class and provides its implementation of the draw method. These classes are open for extension because you can add new shapes by creating new classes without modifying the existing code (closed for modification).

By following the OCP, you can easily add new shapes to your drawing application by creating new classes for those shapes, promoting code extensibility and maintainability without altering existing code.

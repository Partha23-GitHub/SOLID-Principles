**The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**

It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Violating this principle can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. Let's go through an example in Java to understand how to violate and then adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle.

**Violating Liskov Substitution Principle:**
Consider a classic example involving a interface Bird and two implementation classes Eagle and Penguin. In this example, we will violate LSP by introducing a fly method in the Bird Interface.

```java
    // Bird interface defines the common behaviors for all birds.
    public interface Bird {
        void eat();
        void makeSound();
        void fly();
    }
```

```java
    class Eagle implements Bird {
        @Override
        public void eat() {
            System.out.println("Eagle is eating plants.");
        }

        @Override
        public void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Eagle makes a booming sound.");
        }

        @Override
        public void Fly() {
            System.out.println("Eagle is flying.");
        }

    }
```

```java
    class Penguin implements Bird {
        @Override
        public void eat() {
            System.out.println("Penguin is eating fish.");
        }

        @Override
        public void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Penguin makes a braying sound.");
        }

        @Override
        public void Fly() {
            throw new Exception("Penguin can't fly"); // because Penguin can't fly
        }
    }
```

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Bird eagle = new Eagle();

            eagle.eat();
            eagle.makeSound();
            eagle.fly();    //this 3 methods works fine for eagle

            Bird penguin = new Penguin();

            penguin.eat();
            penguin.makeSound();
            penguin.fly();  //this fly() method will throw an exception.
            /* For this fly() method we are narrowing down our implementations.This code won't run, that means we can't substitute child object new Penguin() with parent Bird. This implementation violates LSP*/
        }
    }
```

**Adhering to Liskov Substitution Principle:**
Let's have a look how we can overcome this problem, we should design our classes like this:

We can change the Bird interface by putting only those method which is common for all child, like eat() and makeSound().

```java
    public interface Bird{
        void eat();
        void makeSound();
    }
```

Now let's create two different types of birds that implement the same interface and override some methods differently.

```java
    public interface CanFly extends Bird{
        void fly();
    }
```

```java
    public interface CannotFly extends Bird{

    }
```

And now we can implement these interface with concreate classes like-

```java
    class Eagle implements CanFly {
        @Override
        public void eat() {
            System.out.println("Eagle is eating plants.");
        }

        @Override
        public void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Eagle makes a booming sound.");
        }

        @Override
        public void Fly() {
            System.out.println("Eagle is flying.");
        }
    }
```

```java
    class Penguin implements CannotFly {
        @Override
        public void eat() {
            System.out.println("Penguin is eating fish.");
        }

        @Override
        public void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Penguin makes a braying sound.");
        }
    }
```

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Bird eagle = new Eagle();

            eagle.eat();
            eagle.makeSound();
            eagle.fly();    //this 3 methods works fine for eagle

            Bird penguin = new Penguin();

            penguin.eat();
            penguin.makeSound();

            /*Here you can't call fly() method because penguin implements CannotFly interface. That means you can replace the object of child penguin with parent Bird without breaking the implementation */
        }
    }
```

In this example, we've defined the Bird interface with common bird behaviors like eat and makeSound. Both Eagle and Penguin implement this interface, providing their own specific implementations for these methods. Now, we adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle because we can use objects of Eagle and Penguin interchangeably with objects of Bird without violating the expected behavior of the Bird interface.

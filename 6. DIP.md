**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

**Problem:**
Imagine you are developing a simple notification system in Java. You have a NotificationService class that sends notifications via email and SMS. Here's a simplified version of this class:

```java
    public class NotificationService {
        public void sendEmailNotification(String message) {
            // Code to send an email notification
            System.out.println("Email notification: " + message);
        }

        public void sendSmsNotification(String message) {
            // Code to send an SMS notification
            System.out.println("SMS notification: " + message);
        }
    }

```

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            NotificationSender sender = new NotificationService();

            sender.sendEmailNotification("Hello, this is an email notification");
            sender.sendSmsNotification("Hello, this is an SMS notification");
        }
    }
```

Suppose in future I added a WhatsApp notification service. Then i have to add this public void sendWhatsappNotification(String message) inside well tested NotificationService class which is violating Single Responsibility Principle. For that i have to create a new class for WhatsappNotificationService like :-

```java
    public class WhatsappNotificationService {
        public void sendWhatsappNotification(String message) {
            // Code to send an email notification
            System.out.println("Whatsapp notification: " + message);
        }
    }
```

But how can I call this from main method? for that again i have to create a object of WhatsappNotificationService, then call this sendWhatsappNotification() method using that object like :-

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            NotificationSender sender = new NotificationService();

            sender.sendEmailNotification("Hello, this is an email notification");
            sender.sendSmsNotification("Hello, this is an SMS notification");

            //for whatsapp
            WhatsappNotificationService whatsappSender=new WhatsappNotificationService();
            whatsappSender.sendWhatsappNotification("Hello, this is an Whatsapp notification");
        }
    }
```

In this way in future if we add more notification we have to change our implementation again and again because in this design, the NotificationService directly depends on concrete implementations for sending email and SMS notifications. This design violates the DIP because high-level modules (e.g., NotificationService) are tightly coupled to low-level modules (e.g., email and SMS sending code). If you want to add new notification methods or change the way notifications are sent, you would need to modify the NotificationService class.

**Solution (DIP Implementation):**

To adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle, we should introduce abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) that both high-level and low-level modules depend on. Abstractions should define the contract, and concrete implementations should depend on these abstractions.

Let's refactor the code:

```java
    // Abstract notification sender interface
    public interface NotificationSender {
        void sendNotification(String message);
    }
```

```java
    // Email notification sender
    public class EmailNotificationSender implements NotificationSender {
        @Override
        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            // Code to send an email notification
            System.out.println("Email notification: " + message);
        }
    }
```

```java
    // SMS notification sender
    public class SmsNotificationSender implements NotificationSender {
        @Override
        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            // Code to send an SMS notification
            System.out.println("SMS notification: " + message);
        }
    }
```

```java
    // High-level module depending on abstractions
    public class NotificationService {
        private final NotificationSender notificationSender;    //object of interface i.e high level

        public NotificationService(NotificationSender notificationSender) {
            this.notificationSender = notificationSender;
        }

        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            notificationSender.sendNotification(message);
        }
    }

```

**DIP Implementation Explanation:**

1. We introduce the NotificationSender interface, defining the contract for sending notifications. Both email and SMS senders implement this interface.

2. EmailNotificationSender and SmsNotificationSender are concrete implementations of the NotificationSender interface. They provide the details of how email and SMS notifications are sent.

3. The NotificationService class now depends on the NotificationSender interface via constructor injection. It no longer depends on concrete implementations directly.

Usage Example (main method):
Here's how you can use the refactored code:

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {

            NotificationService emailService = new NotificationService( new EmailNotificationSender());
            emailService.sendNotification("Hello, this is an email notification");

            NotificationService smsService = new NotificationService(new SmsNotificationSender());
            smsService.sendNotification("Hello, this is an SMS notification");
        }
    }

```

Now suppose in Future I require a Whatsapp Notification Service for that I just need a whatsapp notification sender class that override the sendNotification(String message) method of Notification sender interface

```java
    // Whatsapp notification sender
    public class WhatsappNotificationSender implements NotificationSender {
        @Override
        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            // Code to send an Whatsapp notification
            System.out.println("Whatsapp notification: " + message);
        }
    }
```

And main method will look like-

```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {

            NotificationService emailService = new NotificationService( new EmailNotificationSender());
            emailService.sendNotification("Hello, this is an email notification");

            NotificationService smsService = new NotificationService(new SmsNotificationSender());
            smsService.sendNotification("Hello, this is an SMS notification");

            //add new whatsapp notification service
            NotificationService whatsappService = new NotificationService(new WhatsappNotificationSender());
            whatsappService.sendNotification("Hello, this is an Whatsapp notification");
        }
    }

```

In this example, you create instances of EmailNotificationSender,SmsNotificationSender and WhatsappNotificationSender and inject them into the NotificationService class using Constructor injection. This allows you to switch between different notification senders without modifying the NotificationService class, demonstrating adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
